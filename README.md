### What I learned

This was a nice challenging project. One of which I hope to tackle again in the future and make some adjustments. Especially the responsive portion. The design of laying out the ratings buttons was figuring out how. I first used unordered lists, but then realized I had to figure out to have a button actually select when "clicked". Then it made more sense to use radio buttons. The second biggest challenge was figuring out which of the buttons was selected.

```js
const selectedButton = document.querySelector("input[name='rating']:checked");
selectedRating.innerHTML = `You selected ${selectedButton.id} out of ${radioButtons.length}`;
```

This snippet shows which one of the rating buttons is checked and then I could use that value for a span element from the HTML document.

### Useful resources
